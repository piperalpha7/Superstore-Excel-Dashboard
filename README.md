# Superstore Data Analysis on Excel

Please Note this is not a real dataset and any resemblance to the stores or names is purely a coincidence

I did this project as part of the Technology Pioneer programme at Albany Beck. 

The dataset was provided in Excel and had details of products and customers pertaining to Superstore in the United States of America between the year 2014 to 2017.

I used advanced Excel methods like Pivot Tables, Lookups, Slicers, What-if Analysis to analyse and present my findings in an interactive Dashboard.

I planned to present my Dashboard/report in 4 pages. They are as follows:

ðŸ‘‰ Sales and Profits

ðŸ‘‰ Categories

ðŸ‘‰ Orders and Customers

ðŸ‘‰ Growth and What-if Analysis

Let me now decribe each page briefly and some of the key insights I discovered.


## Sales and Profits

### Some Key Insights

ðŸ‘‰ Total Sales - $2.297M

ðŸ‘‰ Total Profit - $2.86K

ðŸ‘‰ Total Discount - $3.227K

ðŸ‘‰ Profit % - 12.47%

ðŸ‘‰ Total Sales - $2.297M

ðŸ‘‰ The 'Consumer'  segment alone constituted around 50% of total sales and profit

ðŸ‘‰ Profit rose every year between 2014 to 2017 whiles sales saw a slump in the year 2015.

ðŸ‘‰ Central Region had the least profit of 7.92%.

ðŸ‘‰ The 'Furniture' category amounted to 32% of the total sales while the profit generated by this category was a mere 6% only

ðŸ‘‰ California and New York were the Top states both in terms of Profits and sales.

### Some Key Insights

ðŸ‘‰ As we had seen above that Furniture was the least profitable category. I noticed that 2 loss making products  in this category were 'Tables' and 'Book cases'
Incidentally very high discounts were offered while selling these products which lead to the superstore incurring losses.

ðŸ‘‰ Most Profitable Category - Technology

ðŸ‘‰ Most Loss making category - Furniture

ðŸ‘‰ Returned Products amounted to a loss of $23232.


## Orders and Customers

### Some Key Insights


ðŸ‘‰ The number of orders fell every Wedsnesday

ðŸ‘‰ Average days to ship 

1. Same Day Delivery - 0 days

2. First Class - 2 Days

3. Second Class - 3 Days

4. Standard Class - 5 Days
   

ðŸ‘‰ Roughly 60 % of orders were ordered through Standard Class


ðŸ‘‰ Tamara Chand and Raymond Buch were the 2nd and 3rd highest customers interms of the amount they spent but the discounts offered to them were only 0.22% and 0.44%


ðŸ‘‰ Customers like Paul Knutson and Cindy Stewart spent less but very high discounts (63% and 61%) were given to them.



## Growth and What-If Analysis

### Some Key Insights

ðŸ‘‰ Sales and Profits both grew Year-on-Year but the rate at which they were growing were falling

ðŸ‘‰ Discovered through what if analysis that the Furnitures Category could not sustain and started making loss when offerd 20% discount.

ðŸ‘‰ The Office Supplies and Technology Category were still profitable until 30% discount was offered but started making loss when 40% discount was offered. 


## Recommendations

ðŸ‘‰ Check why the 'Central' zone is underperforming. Is it because a lot of 'Furniture' is sold there.


ðŸ‘‰ Reduce the discounts offered on 'Tables,'Binders' and ' Machines'... all in excess of 22 % currently.


ðŸ‘‰ Consider stopping the sales of Tables and Bookcases since they are bleeding the profits . Also since they require godowns to store them being large items.
   They have a lot of overhead costs.
   

ðŸ‘‰ Consider keeping attractive mini shopping festivals like 'Welcome Wednesdays' to boost sales on Wednesdays.    


ðŸ‘‰ Make it a point to reduce discounts and not offer above 20% on any product.
